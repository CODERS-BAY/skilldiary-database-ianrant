## MONDAY, February 3rd

Dear Diary,

today was the first day of the course. Apart from formal and organizations aspects, there was a bunch of installing
and setting up to do (GitHub, GitHub Classroom, Git Kraken, Visual Studio Code).

Then, individually, we did a video tutorial for IntelliJ. It went... interesting for most of us.

KNOWLEDGE GAINED:
* IntelliJ may auomatically insert comments that can be mistaken for code. 
* When I am uncertain and I delete the element in question AND the whole code still works - then it's a comment.

IMPROVEMENT/INSIGHT NEEDED:
* I need to devote some time to how classes, methods, constructors and their interaction works.
* Also, I might understand the concept of GIT and/or the sync better if I was provided a more complex example.
* This example should demonstrate a collaboration of several people.
* The example video from GIT does not provide that level of detail.


Also, dear diary, I am confident that - in time - I can abandon this style of writing and stop resembling an overly eager
nine-year-old who does everything by the book in fear of irrational parental retaliation.

_Toodles!_
