MONDAY, February 3rd

Dear Diary,

today was the first day of the course. Apart from formal and organizations aspects, there was a bunch of installing
and setting up to do (GitHub, GitHub Classroom, Git Kraken, Visual Studio Code).

Then, individually, we did a video tutorial for IntelliJ. It went... interesting for most of us.

KNOWLEDGE GAINED:
IntelliJ may auomatically insert comments that can be mistaken for code. When I am uncertain and I delete the element
in question AND the whole code still works - then it's a comment.

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
I will devote some time this evening to how classes, methods, constructors and their interaction works.


Also, dear diary, I am confident that - in time - I can abandon this style of writing and stop resembling an overly eager
nine-year-old who does everything by the book in fear of irrational parental retaliation.

Toodles!
