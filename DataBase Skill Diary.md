## THURSDAY, February 13rd

KNOWLEDGE GAINED:
* IntelliJ may auomatically insert comments that can be mistaken for code. 
* When I am uncertain and I delete the element in question AND the whole code still works - then it's a comment.

IMPROVEMENT/INSIGHT NEEDED:
* I need to devote some time to how classes, methods, constructors and their interaction works.
* Also, I might understand the concept of GIT and/or the sync better if I was provided a more complex example.
* This example should demonstrate a collaboration of several people.
* The example video from GIT does not provide that level of detail.
